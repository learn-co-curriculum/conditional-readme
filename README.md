# Control Flow

## Objectives

- Define control flow for when a Ruby program is executed.
- Implement control flow in different ways.
- Use `if`, `else`, and `elsif` statements.

## Define Control Flow

> A control flow construct is a language feature which disrupts the normal
> progression to the next statement and conditionally or unconditionally
> branches to another location in source code.

In other words, control flow lets you tell your program what code to execute
conditionally. As humans, we actually enact flow control *every day*. For
instance, if you are hungry, you will go and get a snack. Otherwise, you'll stay
put and continue to read this awesome readme.

Control flow is an important part of Ruby programming and web development. In
the context of a web application, for example, you can easily think of content
or functionality on a website you've visited that is only available to a user
*if* that user is logged in.

## Implementing Control Flow

There are several ways to tell your program to conditionally execute certain
code, the basic forms of which are:

- `if`, `else`, and `elsif` statements,
- `case` statements,
- loops.

In this reading, we're going to discuss the first group of these "conditional"
statements: `if`, `else`, and `elsif`.

Use IRB, copying the provided code snippets, to follow along in this lesson.

### `if` Statements

One of the most common ways to enact control flow is the `if` statement.
Whatever block of code that follows the `if` statement will get evaluated—i.e.
read and enacted by the computer. If this evaluation of the `if` statement
results in `true`, then the code through to the associated `end` statement will
run.

Let's look at a few examples:

```ruby
if 5 > 2
  print "5 is greater than 2"
end
```

- The code above will print "5 is greater than 2" because the `if` statement
  evaluates as `true`.

Meanwhile:

```ruby
if 2 > 5
  puts "2 is greater than 5"
end
```

- The code above will not print anything because the `if` statement evaluates as `false`.

So what if we want our program to print something *else* when the `if` condition
evaluates as `false`?

### The `else` Keyword

To accomplish this, we can follow an `if` statement with an `else` statement. Take a look:

```ruby
if false
   puts "This will never get printed because the above
     statement evaluates to false."
else
   puts "This will get printed!"
end
```

An `else` statement sets a "default" condition for when your `if` statement's
conditional evaluates as `false`. Every condition that doesn't evaluate as
`true` will instead pass through the `else` statement.

#### Further Examples

So far, we've seen `if` statements that rely on the explicit use of the `true`
and `false` booleans. Let's look at some examples that require a little more
thought.

##### Example 1

```ruby
if 6 + 3 == 9
  puts "Giraffes have no vocal cords."
end
# └── "Giraffes have no vocal cords."
```

- The code above will print `Giraffes have no vocal cords.` Since `6 + 3` equals
  `9` (i.e. `9` is equal to `9`), the `if` statement's conditional evaluates as
  `true`.

**Top-tip:** *Remember that the comparative operator* `==` *("double-equals") is
used to check equality. This is distinct from the assignment operator*
`=`*("single-equals"), which is used to set the value of a variable.*

##### Example 2

```ruby
if 6 + 3 < 5
  puts "The hummingbird is the only animal that can fly backwards"
end
```

- The code above will not print anything because `6 + 3`, which is equivalent to
  `9`, is *not* less than `5`, making the `if` statement's conditional evaluate
  as `false`.

##### Example 3

```ruby
dog = "satisfied"

if dog == "hungry"
  puts "Refilling food bowl."
else
  puts "Reading newspaper."
end

#  └── "Reading newspaper."
```

### `elsif` Statements

Sometimes, we want to control the flow of our program based on more than one
condition. For example, if I am hungry, then I will get a snack. If I am
thirsty, then I will get a drink of water. Otherwise, I will stay here and
continue learning more about control flow.

We can add additional layers of complexity to our `if` and `else` statements by
using the `elsif` keyword.

Let's add an `elsif` statement to Example 3 from above:

```ruby
dog = "thirsty"

if dog == "hungry"
  puts "Refilling food bowl."
elsif dog == "thirsty"
  puts "Refilling water bowl."
else
  puts "Reading newspaper."
end

#  └── "Refilling water bowl."
```

We can cascade as many `elsif` statements as we wish, however `elsif` statements
can only be used following an `if` statement, and must precede the associated
`else` statement (if used).

```ruby
dog = "cuddly"

if dog == "hungry"
  puts "Refilling food bowl."
elsif dog == "thirsty"
  puts "Refilling water bowl."
elsif dog == "playful"
  puts "Playing tug-of-war."
elsif dog == "cuddly"
  puts "Snuggling."
else
  puts "Reading newspaper."
end

#  └── "Snuggling."
```

That's all for now—we'll discuss `case` statements and looping in upcoming
lessons.
